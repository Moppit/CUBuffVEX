## Competition Code
All of our autonomous, drive, and robot skills code for each of the robots is stored here. The folder
is categorized by Big/Small bot, and the naming convention goes:
```[B/S]Bot-[Field].vex```
### Table of Contents
1. Big Bot
	1.1 BBot-Blue.vex
	1.2 BBot-Red.vex
2. Small Bot
	2.1 SBot-Blue.vex
	2.2 SBot-Red.vex
	2.3 SBot-Skills.vex
## Code Base
Some class implementations are consistent between seasons. As we use C++ Pro with VEX Coding Studio, 
we've saved many of our basic classes and functions as .cpp files. These classes are then incorporated
into our competition code.
### Table of Contents
1. Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) Class
2. Chassis/DriveTrain Class
3. Debugger Class
4. Controller Class
5. Sensor Class
6. pre_auton()
7. autonomous()
8. usercontrol()
